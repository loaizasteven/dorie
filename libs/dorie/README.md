# Interactive development

The modules in this project are treated as part of the package, DORIE, and thus are intended to be imported .. executing the `__init__.py`. 

For local testing via command line, consider running modules from their parent directory using the `-m` flag, which allows you to run a module as a script. For example `python -m intent.finetune`, notice that the extension `.py` is not used.
